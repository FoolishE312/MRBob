# Questions and Answers

Q: Does this contain answer keys for any work?

A: Not at all.
This is solely the concepts for AP Precalculus, nothing more.
I cannot provide answer keys, anyway, for many reasons.
Besides, you don't need the keys, you should be able to figure this out just fine.

Q: How did you get the notes for all of this?

A: Either from my friends in lower-tier classes, or from my teachers.
If you really need the blank notes, Mr. Sindel does provide them on his website, and it's perfectly fine.
Granted, the answers are inaccessible unless you request access, and I cannot assist with that.

Little more on AP Precalculus, at the time of writing we're in the middle of Unit 3, I dug up my notes from Unit 1 and still need to find mine from Unit 2 to complete the set thus far.

Q: Why is Conic Sections there, but nothing else from Unit 4? (will be removed in the coming months)

A: After our cumulative exam over Units 1 and 2, our teacher decided to put in Conics just to act as a two-week filler, until our school-mandated final.
Unit 4 won't start until maybe March, or later.

Q: Did you ask anyone for permission to use any material?

A: I haven't.
While where I am, AP Precalculus, is derived from Bryan Passwater's notes, and we've been given his notes to study with in-person, I am not uploading them here, and these concepts are publicly available knowledge anyway.
If anyone has any concerns, just let me know. I keep a good eye on my GitHub account.

Q: Any plans for other subjects?

A: If I feel like it, maybe. Had one of my friends suggest an Economics section, or APUSH/APWH/APEH, but they aren't layouted as easily.
I'd be glad if someone worked on it through Pull Requests, though.

Q: Hey, `insert math class` is missing, when's that coming?

A: I have no clue.
I have no timeline, this is a low-priority project for me anyway.
But, if you must know, here's something to hold you:

* AP Calculus AB / BC: Whenever the 2025-2026 school year rolls around, I'll get to it.
* Algebra I/II: I might bother a friend of mine to send copies of their notes.
* Geometry: No idea. Geometry is important as a precursor to APPC, but I don't have anyone I know in Geometry right now.
