# Glossary

This is a list of every single term introduced, by unit section, in order of introduction.
Also, I copy and pasted all of these from their respective pages, because I'm lazy.

The unit / subunit to the right of the term is when it is introduced.

> If a term is labeled [UNOFFICIAL], do NOT reference it on the AP Exam.
Instead, either refer to its states or otherwise.
The unofficial terms are not taught in classes and henceforth should not be used.

Have fun.



## AP Precalculus {switcher-key="AP Precalculus"}

Domain (1.1)
: Independent variable $\|\; x$.
Usually represented in inequality / interval notation.
Both are provided in these pages.

Function (1.1)
: A relation that follows the guideline of **every input having exactly one output**.
The words in bold you will hear a lot.
In fact, you'll probably use it on the AP Exam, so keep it in mind now.

Range (1.1)
: Dependent variable $\|\; y$.
Same representation as Domain.

Relation (1.1)
: A tie between an input and an output.
An input of 2 might become 3, an input of 2 could also become 4.
A relation is not always a function.
