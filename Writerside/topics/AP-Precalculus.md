# AP Precalculus

AP Precalculus is the first taste of an AP mathematics class for most, as it was recently introduced.
With four units, three on the exam, it doesn't seem too hard, but it's a massive preparation time for Calculus.

Most of it is remembering Geometry, Algebra, and remembering everything in between.
The class also expands on the topics, with new trigonometric things like graphing, polar / parametric functions, or modeling.

All listed names are the official named that Collegeboard gives them, added when I am taught them.
