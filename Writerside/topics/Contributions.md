# Contributions

This all built on JetBrains Writerside, a backend for technical documentation, frontended with GitHub Pages
Using GitHub pages is very nice to build things off of, and while I don't have a method as to how you can contribute, I'll probably copy and paste something else I've written and put it here.

Otherwise, this repository is yours to fork and make changes to, PR, and have it approved, because I want this to be a community effort.

One last thing, thank you to these people:

Bryan Passwater
: Made nearly every single paper I've ever had for AP Precalculus.
An absolute legend in our eyes, and he's the guy I pull a lot of my notes from.
: We thank you, all of us do.
