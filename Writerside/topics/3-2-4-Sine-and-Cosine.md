# 3.2-4: Sine and Cosine

This is split up into four parts.

* 3.2: Radian Angle Measures / Sine, Cosine, and Tangent
* 3.3: Sine and Cosine Function Values
* 3.4: Sine and Cosine Function Graphs

## 3.2 Overview {switcher-key="3.2"}

Unit 3.2 is commonly split into two parts, which is the same here.

Part 1 is discussing Radians, and why we use them instead of Degrees in AP Precalculus.

Part 2 is about the initial 3 trigonometric functions that the unit takes its name from -
sine, cosine, and tangent.

> If you remember anything about geometry, those names should be familiar, so keep what you've learned in the past, in mind.

### _Part 1: Radians_

### Terms

Radian
: An alternate way to measure angle.
There are $2 \pi$ radians around a circle, keep that in mind.
