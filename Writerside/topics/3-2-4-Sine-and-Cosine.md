# 3.2-4: Sine and Cosine

This is split up into four parts.

* 3.2: Radian Angle Measures / Sine, Cosine, and Tangent
* 3.3: Sine and Cosine Function Values
* 3.4: Sine and Cosine Function Graphs

## 3.2 Overview {switcher-key="3.2"}

Unit 3.2 is commonly split into two parts, which is the same here.

Part 1 is for figuring out sine, cosine, and tangent.

Part 2 is discussing Radians, and why they're used over degrees in APPC.

> If you remember anything about geometry, those names should be familiar, so keep what you've learned in the past, in mind.
