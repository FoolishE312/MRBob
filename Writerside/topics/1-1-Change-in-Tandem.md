# 1.1: Change in Tandem

## Overview

This is the first thing you'll learn, and it's new content right out the gate.
Simple, but new. Not very much to talk about, it's just slope and graphs and things.

## Beginning Terms

Relation
: A tie between an input and an output.
An input of 2 might become 3, an input of 2 could also become 4.
A relation is not always a function.

Function
: A relation that follows the guideline of **every input having exactly one output**.
The words in bold you will hear a lot.
In fact, you'll probably use it on the AP Exam, so keep it in mind now.

Domain
: Independent variable $\| \; x$.
Usually represented in inequality / interval notation.
Both are provided in these pages.

Range
: Dependent variable $\| \; y$.
Same representation as Domain.

Rate of Change (Slope)
: The value / description of how a function changes.
Usually represented as $\frac{rise}{run} \; \| \; \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$

## AP Aside

In the AP Precalculus course, usually there will be four representations for a problem.
All four of these will be on the exam.
They are: graphs, equations, tables, and word problems.

Get familiar with all of them, you're going to need it.

On an unrelated note, any terms that have [UNOFFICIAL] next to them shouldn't be used on any exam.

## Beginning with Graphs

Graphs are the backbone of AP Precalculus, I feel.
Being one of the four horsemen of the exam, looking at one and knowing what it means is crucial.
In 1.1, we're starting with the basics.

### "Positivity"

This isn't an official term, as it isn't defined like one, but here it is.

Positivity [UNOFFICIAL]
: The state of the graph dependent on output values.
Can be in one of two states: positive or negative.
The graph / function is positive on an x-value if the according output is positive, likewise for negative.
If the output is 0, it is neither.

Let us have an example for this one, just to cement it.

![A graph of the function f(x) = 3x+2](1.1.positivity.png)

This is a graph of the function $f(x) = 3x + 2$.

> If I ever use "function $f$", it's referring to $f(x)$.
Apply that to all other letters.
{style="note"}

Looking at the graph, anything past $x = -\frac{4}{3}$ is above the x-axis, representing positive y-values.
Therefore, function $f$ is positive from $-\frac{4}{3} < x < \infty \; \| \; (-\frac{4}{3}, \infty)$.

> Infinity will never have an equal sign, or a bracket.
This is because infinity is an undefined value, for the sake of this course.

> An output value of zero is neither positive nor negative, hence the non-equality / parenthesis.
Always assume positivity zones will be only exclusive, unless stated otherwise.
{style="warning"}

### Graphical Behavior

#### Quickly Touching on Bounds
For most parts of this, graphs will be unbounded.
This means that inequalities / intervals will go to infinity in one / two direction(s) in most cases.
If I ever do specify a bound, like "... graph of $f$ from $-2 \leq x \leq 2$", then the inequality / interval will not go past -2 or 2.

Also, $\cup$.
This is the "union" symbol, joining two intervals, such as $[0, 3) \cup (3, 5]$, which is usually used to get around an exclusive point or hole (that's later!)

#### The Behavior
We've already looked at Positivity, but there are four more things a graph can have.

State of Change [UNOFFICIAL]
: Describing how the graph is sloped.
Has two states: increasing and decreasing.
If the slope is positive, it's increasing.
If the slope is negative, it's decreasing.

Concavity
: Describing the change in the rate of change (shape of the graph).
If the rate of change is increasing, it's concave up.
If the rate of change is decreasing, it's concave down.
: There's a common piece to remember it, usually in reference to parabolas (that's later!).
: "Up like a cup, down like a frown"

Point of Inflection
: Where the graph changes concavity.
It will be where the rate of change is the greatest / least between two sections, or the "steepest".
Helpful for determing concavity.

> Questions will often attempt to trick you.
This is generally how it will always be on the exam, be prepared for horrible wording.
A common trick is to used "$f$ is increasing" and "the rate of change of $f$ is increasing", which mean two functionally different things but are similar at a glance.
Do not confuse the two.
{style="warning"}

For an example, take this graph.

![A graph of the function g(x) = x^2](1.1.scc.png)

This is a graph of the function $g(x) = x^2$.
The graph is increasing from $0 < x < \infty \; \| \; (0, \infty)$,
and decreasing from $-\infty < x < 0 \; \| \; (-\infty, 0)$.
The graph is also exclusively concave up, because the rate of change of $g$ is increasing.

> For any graph of $x^n$, where n is any even number, it will always be either concave up or concave down.
If the function leads with a negative, it's down, otherwise, it's up.
This is a useful shorthand to know immediately if these simple functions are opening up or down.

### Putting it All Together

One final graph to look at, and this one is more fit for an AP course.

![A graph of the function h(x) = 2x^4 - 3x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x](1.1.together.png)

This is a graph of the function $h(x) = 2x^4 - 3x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x$.

For a few examples (these are all to the nearest tenth by eye):

1. Function $h$ is negative and concave up from the interval of $(-1, 0) \cup (1, 1.6)$.
2. Function $h$ is increasing and positive from the interval of $(0, 0.6) \cup (1.6, \infty)$.
3. Function $h$ is positive from the interval of $(-\infty, -1) \cup (0, 1) \cup (1.6, \infty)$.

> The AP exam uses intervals, so please get familiar with them.
From 1.2 forward I will not list inequality notation, unless we're talking about graphical / function bounds.

## Conclusion
1.1 is generally regarded as the easiest AP Precalculus has to offer, but it's just as important as everything else.
These initial pages will serve as a foundation, use them well.
