# 1.1: Change in Tandem

## Overview

This is the first thing you'll learn, and it's new content right out the gate.
Simple, but new. Not very much to talk about, it's just slope and graphs and things.

## Beginning Terms

Relation
: A tie between an input and an output.
An input of 2 might become 3, an input of 2 could also become 4.
A relation is not always a function.

Function
: A relation that follows the guideline of **every input having exactly one output**.
The words in bold you will hear a lot.
In fact, you'll probably use it on the AP Exam, so keep it in mind now.

Domain
: Independent variable $\|\; x$.
Usually represented in inequality / interval notation.
Both are provided in these pages.

Range
: Dependent variable $\|\; y$.
Same representation as Domain.

## AP Aside

In the AP Precalculus course, usually there will be four representations for a problem.
All four of these will be on the exam.
They are: graphs, equations, tables, and word problems.

Get familiar with all of them, you're going to need it.

## Beginning with Graphs

Graphs are the backbone of AP Precalculus, I feel.
Being one of the four horsemen of the exam, looking at one and knowing what it means is crucial.
In 1.1, we're starting with the basics.

### "Positivity"

There's no real blanket term for this, but it's here.
Take a function, $f(x)=3x+2$.

> If we ever refer to "function $f$", then it's the function labeled $f(x)$; this applies to all letters.
{style="note"}

If you look at the graph of the function, pictured here:

![A graph of the function f(x) = 3x+2](1.1.positivity.png)

now we have a basis for these terms.

Positivity is defining if $f$ is positive or negative.
To be positive, the outputs must be above the x-axis, or above 0.
To be negative, on the other hand, the outputs must be below the x-axis, or below 0.

If a question asks *over which interval is function $f$ positive*, the answer is $(\frac {-4}{3}, \infty)$
