# 1.1: Change in Tandem

## Overview

This is the first thing you'll learn, and it's new content right out the gate.
Simple, but new. Not very much to talk about, it's just slope and graphs and things.

## Beginning Terms

Relation
: A tie between an input and an output.
An input of 2 might become 3, an input of 2 could also become 4.
A relation is not always a function.

Function
: A relation that follows the guideline of **every input having exactly one output**.
The words in bold you will hear a lot.
In fact, you'll probably use it on the AP Exam, so keep it in mind now.

Domain
: Independent variable $\| \; x$.
Usually represented in inequality / interval notation.
Both are provided in these pages.

Range
: Dependent variable $\| \; y$.
Same representation as Domain.

Rate of Change (Slope)
: The value / description of how a function changes.
Usually represented as $\frac{rise}{run} \; \| \; \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$

## AP Aside

In the AP Precalculus course, usually there will be four representations for a problem.
All four of these will be on the exam.
They are: graphs, equations, tables, and word problems.

Get familiar with all of them, you're going to need it.

## Beginning with Graphs

Graphs are the backbone of AP Precalculus, I feel.
Being one of the four horsemen of the exam, looking at one and knowing what it means is crucial.
In 1.1, we're starting with the basics.

### "Positivity"

This isn't an official term, as it isn't defined like one, but here it is.

Positivity [UNOFFICIAL]
: The state of the graph dependent on output values.
Can be in one of two states: positive or negative.
The graph / function is positive on a x-value if the according output is positive, likewise for negative.
If the output is 0, it is neither.

Let us have an example for this one, just to cement it.

![A graph of the function f(x) = 3x+2](1.1.positivity.png)

This is a graph of the function $f(x) = 3x + 2$.

> If I ever use "function $f$", it's referring to $f(x)$.
Apply that to all other letters.
{style="note"}

Looking at the graph, anything past $x = -\frac{4}{3}$ is above the x-axis, representing positive y-values.
Therefore, function $f$ is positive from $-\frac{4}{3} < x < \infty \; \| \; (-\frac{4}{3}, \infty)$.

> Infinity will never have an equal sign, or a bracket.
This is because infinity is an undefined value, for the sake of this course.

> An output value of zero is neither positive nor negative, hence the non-equality / parenthesis.
Always assume positivity zones will be only exclusive, unless stated otherwise.

### Graphical Behavior

We've already looked at Positivity, but there are four more things a graph can have.

State of Change [UNOFFICIAL]
: Describing how the graph is sloped.
Has two states: increasing and decreasing.
If the slope is positive, it's increasing.
If the slope is negative, it's decreasing.

Concavity
: Describing the change in the rate of change (shape of the graph).
If the rate of change is increasing, it's concave up.
If the rate of change is decreasing, it's concave down.
: There's a common piece to remember it, usually in reference to parabolas (that's later!).
: "Up like a cup, down like a frown"
