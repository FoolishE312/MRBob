# 3.1: Periodic Phenomena

Periodic Phenomena is a great introduction to Unit 3, which is full of trigonometric functions, and this is a necessary first step in truly understanding them.
I know trig was done in Geometry and Algebra II, but there's a lot more to it now.

## Terms

Periodic Function
: A relationship between two variables in which across equal-length input intervals, output values will repeat.

Period
: The length of the input interval for a periodic function to complete one cycle (i.e. time before it repeats).

## Application

Say you have some graph, or a table of points. Let's begin with a graph.

If you can see the numbers, great. This is a graph from $0 \leq x \leq 19 \; \| \, (0, 19)$
The period is 5, because from 0 to 5 is a single cycle.
Afterward, it will repeat, therefore the period is **5**.


## Extension (for 3.4)

Think about a sine / cosine graph in Desmos, really quickly.
The picture is of the equation $\sin(x)$.
