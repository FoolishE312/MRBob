# Glossary

This is a list of every single term introduced, by unit section, in order of introduction.
Also, I copy and pasted all of these from their respective pages, because I'm lazy.

The unit / subunit to the right of the term is when it is first introduced.

> If a term is labeled [UNOFFICIAL], do NOT reference it on the AP Exam.
Instead, either refer to its states or otherwise.
The unofficial terms are not taught in classes and henceforth should not be used.

Have fun.

<tabs>
<tab id="appc_c" title="C">

Concavity (1.1)
: Describing the change in the rate of change (shape of the graph).
If the rate of change is increasing, it's concave up.
If the rate of change is decreasing, it's concave down.
: There's a common piece to remember it, usually in reference to parabolas (that's later!).
: "Up like a cup, down like a frown"

</tab>
<tab id="appc_d" title="D">

Domain (1.1)
: Independent variable $\|\; x$.
Usually represented in inequality / interval notation.
Both are provided in these pages.

</tab>
<tab id="appc_f" title="F">

Function (1.1)
: A relation that follows the guideline of **every input having exactly one output**.
The words in bold you will hear a lot.
In fact, you'll probably use it on the AP Exam, so keep it in mind now.

</tab>
<tab id="appc_p" title="P">

Point of Inflection (1.1)
: Where the graph changes concavity.
It will be where the rate of change is the greatest / least between two sections, or the "steepest".

Positivity [UNOFFICIAL] (1.1)
: The state of the graph dependent on output values.
Can be in one of two states: positive or negative.
The graph / function is positive on an x-value if the according output is positive, likewise for negative.
If the output is 0, it is neither.

</tab>
<tab id="appc_r" title="R">

Range (1.1)
: Dependent variable $\|\; y$.
Same representation as Domain.

Relation (1.1)
: A tie between an input and an output.
An input of 2 might become 3, an input of 2 could also become 4.
A relation is not always a function.

</tab>
<tab id="appc_s" title="S">

State of Change [UNOFFICIAL] (1.1)
: Describing how the graph is sloped.
Has two states: increasing and decreasing.
If the slope is positive, it's increasing.
If the slope is negative, it's decreasing.
