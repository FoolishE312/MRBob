# Glossary

This is a list of every single term introduced, by unit section, in order of introduction.
Also, I copy and pasted all of these from their respective pages, because I'm lazy.

The unit / subunit to the right of the term is when it is first introduced.

> If a term is labeled [UNOFFICIAL], do NOT reference it on the AP Exam.
Instead, either refer to its states or otherwise.
The unofficial terms are not taught in classes and henceforth should not be used.

Have fun.

### Founding Topics

Relation (1.1)
: A tie between an input and an output.
An input of 2 might become 3, an input of 2 could also become 4.
A relation is not always a function.

Function (1.1)
: A relation that follows the guideline of **every input having exactly one output**.
The words in bold you will hear a lot.
In fact, you'll probably use it on the AP Exam, so keep it in mind now.

Domain (1.1)
: Independent variable $\| \; x$.
Usually represented in inequality / interval notation.
Both are provided in these pages.

Range (1.1)
: Dependent variable $\| \; y$.
Same representation as Domain.

Rate of Change (Slope) (1.1)
: The value / description of how a function changes.
Usually represented as $\frac{rise}{run} \; \| \; \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$
: **1.2 Extension**: Specifically the rate of change of a secant line between two points on a graph / interval.
Will always be average, must be two separate points.
WIll change depending on the behavior of the function.

### Functions / Behavior

Positivity [UNOFFICIAL] (1.1)
: The state of the graph dependent on output values.
Can be in one of two states: positive or negative.
The graph / function is positive on an x-value if the according output is positive, likewise for negative.
If the output is 0, it is neither.

State of Change [UNOFFICIAL] (1.1)
: Describing how the graph is sloped.
Has two states: increasing and decreasing.
If the slope is positive, it's increasing.
If the slope is negative, it's decreasing.

Concavity (1.1)
: Describing the change in the rate of change (shape of the graph).
If the rate of change is increasing, it's concave up.
If the rate of change is decreasing, it's concave down.
: There's a common piece to remember it, usually in reference to parabolas (that's later!).
: "Up like a cup, down like a frown"

Point of Inflection (1.1)
: Where the graph changes concavity.
It will be where the rate of change is the greatest / least between two sections, or the "steepest".
Helpful for determing concavity.

Linear Function (1.3)
: A function where the average rate of change is always constant across any length input interval.
: **1.4 Extension**: A function with a degree of 1.

Quadratic Function (1.3)
: A function where the average rate of change is changing at a constant rate across equal-length input intervals.
: **1.4 Extension**: A function with a degree of 2.

Polynomial (1.4)
: placeholder
