# 1.2-3: Rates of Change

## Subunits
This section is split into these following subunits:

* 1.2: Rates of Change
* 1.3: Rates of Change in Linear and Quadratic Functions

<!-- 1.2 -->
## 1.2 Overview {switcher-key="1.2"}
Back in 1.1, Rate of Change was brought up, which is expanded on much more in this subunit.
Rate of Change is a very large pillar of the AP exam, which means it is present all over.

### The Specifics
"Rate of Change" is the umbrella that contains two different things.
One of those is *Average* Rate of Change, which is often what it's referring to in APPC.
In fact, the prior subunit's definition of RoC uses the ARoC definition.

> There is another kind, being *instantaneous* rate of change, but I don't like that definition for the first time you hear it.
It isn't important for APPC, but it's a major component of AP Calculus.

### Calculating

Many times, the formula $\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$ is used to represent average rate of change.

> If you see "$\Delta$" in front of a variable, it means "the change of".
$\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ is the same as the above formula.

This means, when given two points, such as $(3, 5) \; \&\& \; (7, 12)$, you can assign the intervals to respective variables, and solve:

$$
\begin{align*}
x_1 = 3 \\
x_2 = 7 \\
y_1 = 5 \\
y_2 = 12
\end{align*}
$$
$$
\frac{12-5}{7-3}
\to
\frac{7}{4}
$$

The above concludes that $\frac{7}{4}$ is the average rate of change across the two points.

> A "secant line" is asking for ARoC most of the time.
Really, the definition is a line drawn between two points on a function, but it's in the context of rates of change a lot of the time.

### 1.2 Conclusion

This is really just a precursor to 1.3, most times.
Yes, there is some activity on determining if the slope is positive or negative, but realistically, you've already done that by now.

## 1.3 Overview {switcher-key="1.3"}

Finally, we get to our first two classifications of standard functions: linear and quadratic.
