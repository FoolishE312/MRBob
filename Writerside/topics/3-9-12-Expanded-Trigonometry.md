# 3.9-12: Expanded Trigonometry

This section contains these following sub-units:

* 3.9: Inverse Trigonometric Functions
* 3.10: N/A
* 3.11: N/A
* 3.12: N/a

<!-- 3.9 -->

## 3.9 Overview {switcher-key="3.9"}
This subunit covers all of the inverse trigonometric functions from the first three.

### Writing Inverses
Inverses are in two forms: arc and inverse.
They are interchangeable and represent the exact same thing.
Below is both of them.

$$
\sin(\theta) = \frac{y}{r} \to \arcsin(\frac{y}{r}) \; \| \; \sin^{-1}(\frac{y}{r})= \theta
$$

Even though both notations are interchangeable, it's still nearly always said as "arcsine", or whatever other trigonometric function you're using.
This differs from Geometry, where commonly it was just "inverse sine".

> In AP Calculus BC, it's common for it to still be interchangeable.
Thought I'd mention it.
Also, for the sake of the rest of this article, I will be exclusively using arc notation.
See the collapsible section as to why.

#### why {collapsible=true}
okay, so, this is a messy part of LaTeX

for those unaware, LaTeX is how I need to write math because programming sucks (sarcasm)

for arcsine, i just do `$\arcsin(x)$` which becomes $\arcsin(x)$

for inverse i need to do `$\sin^{-1}(x)$` which feels WAY worse to type, and it becomes $\sin^{-1}(x)$

and both is usually `$\arcsin(x) \; \| \; \sin^{-1}(x)$` which i HATE and it's ugly

so that's why

enjoy your day :)

### How to form
If you caught it, in the writing part, I already put how to write the inverses.
Like with any other inverse function (see [2.8](2-8-Inverse-Functions.md)), you need to flip the x and the y variables.
Therefore, $\sin(\dfrac{\pi}{3}) = \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ will turn into
$\arcsin(\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \dfrac{\pi}{3}$.

### The Uses and Delimiters
Inverse trig. is used to find angle measures, instead of finding points or slopes.
