# Unit 1: Polynomial and Rational Functions

## Introduction (for the new people)

Hello, and welcome to AP Precalculus!
I'm slightly glad you gave this a shot, maybe it was your only option, but still, hello.

A lot of the first few units are review, including this one, Unit 1.

## Unit Overview

This unit goes over rates of change, attributes of graphs that will be increasingly useful across the course, and the first two function types you'll learn -
polynomial and rational.

You should've learned about Polynomials in Algebra I, redid them in Algebra II, and done Rationals in Algebra II.
But, of course, there's more to it now, because you're in an AP math class.

Pay attention to the terms early on; I will be referring to them all throughout the pages.
