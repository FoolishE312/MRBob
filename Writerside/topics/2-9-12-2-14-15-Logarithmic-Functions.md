# 2.9-12, 2.14-15: Logarithmic Functions

This is one of the biggest pages so far, split into 6 sub-units.

* 2.9: Logarithmic Expressions
* 2.10: Inverses of Exponential Functions
* 2.11: Logarithmic Functions
* 2.12: Logarithmic Function Manipulation
* 2.14: Logarithmic Function Context and Data Modeling
* 2.15: Semi-log Plots

> This is structured exactly as CollegeBoard does it,
but I believe that 2.13 should be last, since it's inequalities.
As it stands now, that's how it's structured, and I would honestly recommend tackling 2.13 after 2.15.
