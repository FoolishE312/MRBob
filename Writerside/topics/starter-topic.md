For a lot of AP / collegiate math classes, there are so many things to remember.
That's why I've decided to take on pushing all of it into this one page.

Now, there will definitely be a lot to take in, which is why this will be neatly laid out into sections.

> This sort of note is for you to take notes on in case you ever want to, it'll be very concise and brief summaries.

> This sort of note is considerations and important notices, you don't have to take note of these.
{style="note"}

> This final variation of note is a warning, something to be careful of and to consider when doing calculations.
{style="warning"}
