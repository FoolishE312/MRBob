# High School

High School is an odd time for students, but it's by far the most important for career and future college success.
Near every class I can think of is listed here, with AP classes having their own set curriculum - one of the few good things about Collegeboard.
Other than that, all other classes are based on the GSE Honors curriculum, which is Georgia's HS standards.
