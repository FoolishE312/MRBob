# Notation

> When writing the notes for everything, I use a lot of notation, which is going to be defined here.
I recommend you read this page before continuing on to any other math pages, as it should aid in understanding.
As my writings grow longer, this page will increase in size.

Sometimes, math is difficult to read as-is.
The $f(x)$ notation in replacement for $y$ is well known, but then there's the darker end that nobody looks at except for the truly dedicated.
I sometimes use that notation, because it's a concise way to represent a rule / transformation, which is when any symbol I use will be put into this master list.
Also, there's an example for each.

$\|$
: This represents the word "or".
I most often use this when referring to inequality / interval notation, since some are taught one or the other.
: While it isn't official, this is specifically brought from my programming experience.
: Example: $0 \leq x \leq 5 \; \| \; (0,5)$
: `Contribution Note: In LaTex, I usually use "$\; \| \;$" for it.
This is to allow proper spacing between the inequality, or symbol, and interval.`

$\&\&$
: This represents the word "and".
Usually used when referring to multiple solutions.
: Again, brought from my C# knowledge.
: Example: $x = 5 \; \&\& \; x = 3$
: `Contribution Note: In LaTex, I'll use "$\; \&\& \;$" for representing and.
Again, adequate spacing.`
